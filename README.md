Setup walkthrough

Deploy the ELK stack
powershellcd "C:\Users\ELK-Lab" docker compose up -d docker compose ps

Confirms elasticsearch and kibana, both Up.

Configure Fleet Server
Kibana → Fleet → Agents → Add Fleet Server Followed the guided setup, generated the Fleet Server policy and enrollment token

Enroll the Linux (Kali) agent
Ran the generated elastic-agent install command with the Fleet Server URL + enrollment token Agent shows up in Fleet → Agents as kali, status Healthy

Verify data in Kibana
Discover → logs-* and Discover → metrics-* both show live documents from the Fleet Server and Linux agent, timestamps updating in real time

Sysmon on Windows
Installed Sysmon with a baseline config Confirmed Process Create (Event ID 1) events logging under Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon → Operational

Custom YARA rule
Wrote Local_Lab_Malware_Test rule targeting a known string Also tested a rule detecting EICAR test files across a sample directory Ran via PowerShell, logged detections to yara.log

Troubleshooting notes

Had an orphaned elk-lab-fleet-server-1 container appear after a docker compose down -v / up -d cycle — Compose flagged it but didn't block startup; cleaned up manually. docker-compose.yml throws a warning that the top-level version key is obsolete in Compose v2 — cosmetic, doesn't block deployment, but worth stripping out for a clean repo.

Why this project

Built to get hands-on with the exact stack SOC teams use day to day agent-based log collection, host telemetry via Sysmon, and rule-based detection via YARA rather than just reading about them. Next iteration closes the loop: raw detections → SIEM-visible alerts.
